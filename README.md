My CSGO autoexec and other cfgs

Download the config of the player that you want.
Open the zipped file with your preferred program.
Go to your Steam folder (this is usually in ‘Local Disk (C:)‘) and then navigate to ‘Program Files (x86)‘ -> ‘Steam‘ -> ‘userdata‘ -> YOURSTEAMID (this is a bunch of numbers that corresponds with your personal Steam ID number) -> ‘730‘ -> ‘local‘ -> ‘cfg‘.
Place your old config.cfg file in your backup folder.
Place the downloaded config in the cfg map. If it is not already named ‘config.cfg’ you should right click it and rename it so it says exactly ‘config.cfg‘.
